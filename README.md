# hello-world
introductory tutorial, then miscellaneous items.

After running through the tutorial, other itmes would be random feats and ideas, as well as hypothesis testing.

That's it for now.  :-)

The tutorial wanted me to say something about myself. It's something that's always been hard for me--with regards to personal or sensitive items. Some opinions fall into this area, too.
